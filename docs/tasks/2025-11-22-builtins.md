# Built-in Procedures

In this task we are going to add built-in procedures, starting with println. Our plan is:

- To explain how Nutmeg projects will be organised and how that interacts
  with the module system.

- To modify nutmeg-resolver so that it marks top-level variables that are
  defined in the package and those that must come from outside (or be an 
  error)

- To add the automatically imported builtin:: package as an in-memory mapping
  that is applied during resolution, marking matching top-level variables
  as coming from builtin::. We will defer handling name-shadowing.

- In nutmeg-codegen we will recognise calls to built-ins and generate
  syscalls for them.
